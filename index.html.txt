    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am 14 years old and currently studying at the American University of Afghanistan.  
      My dream is to become a doctor, inspired by my love for helping others and curiosity about science.  
      Alongside my studies, I teach English to village girls for free, empowering them with opportunities to learn.  
      I also love coding, languages, and public speaking.  
      Every day I strive to improve myself and inspire others.
